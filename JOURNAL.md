NOTE Times are Romania time based Europe/Bucharest.

DAY 0
Yesterday at about 5 PM I saw a Instagram reel about this cool project.
I started to do some stuff in kicad tho it was not cool so I did not document it as I wasted my time but atleast I learned smth.
I am better at 3D and coding rather then hardware but i took it upon me to start a new hobby which has led me to 'Keyboard Atelier` which has soooo many cool designs. IT INSPIRES me to go beyond and develop my skills as maybe someday I may be able to create a keyboard =D

DAY 1

Started at 8.30PM Romania Time.  Documented myself on the parts and a bit of how PCBs work as it's my first time and started from the past designs and templates 
that are offered. I started to understand and observe a obvious pattern in the designs and how they are wired in the schematic. It took me 2 - 2.30 hours to at least try to design and understand how to create a good version. I first wanted to add 2 rotary encoders and a screen and a 3x3 switch matrix BUT I had no space for pins tried to add a GPI0 hub but it was to hard and I started to downgrade. Offtopic but I just found one of my old childhood songs from SU***DE SQUAD Sucker for Pain it's keeping me sane through the process of trial and error. I got ambitioned by PROTADESIGNS to start smth small and not go all in. So I decided to go with a 3x3 matrix meaning 9 switches an oled screen and another switch next to the display to loop through 4 macro saves a save contains 9 macros meaning about 36 in total idea also taken from PROTADESIGNS. NOTE: It's not an original work but I am having fun creating and understanding along the way. 

SANE NOTE: I researched so much like more than any Class in High School and used like 30% AI to understand how to make pieces go together It's honestly exhausting but I see the reward in the long run. It being the Lessons, Skills & Maybe a Kit to kick start this hobby (:

SUB NOTE as of 11:39 PM I have finished the Schematics:

As of 11:49 I started the actual PCB (Super Note: I am working on the orpheuspad not a clean template as I said I am trying to understand how things go together. BUT I am not copying the design I will just replace the parts they have with my own vision meaning the design won't be the same in any way) 

Idea oh how to make it look: ![Very basic](https://i.imgur.com/z6r63Vy.png)

DAY 3

Now that I look back on the day's 2 design of the pcb it kinda looks like a phone ((: But I think I'll try to make it as compact as i can as I do not wish to have it take this much space and it looks bad lol.

Started on the actual design of the pcb at 10:25 PM trying my best to wire and understand how this actually works (:
Hard but doable

I'm hitting a roadblock in the orpheuspad template they use a WASD layout and i'm using a 3x3 layout and now I'm asking myself HOW TO MAKE IT SMALL as I have the board and the 3x3 diodes then I have the OLED I have to make it look bulkier then it needs to be, OR I can just rotate the XIAO on the back and have the resistors like on the back side while having the switches and oleds on the front NVM won't work as we still have the holes. I can use a SMD but it's not advised for beginners well it's a first project Afterall It doesn't have to look great. I took breaks between 10.25 and 12:10 but I have finished the layout and have all the stuff on the board! Now I need to wire them. It took about 1 hour for this to be completed.

I will go ahead in 3 hours at about 4 PM I will start wiring and then on Day 3 I will build the 3d case and then will try to create a cool little app in python to make the macro thing work!

As i started to work again I wired everything and then decided to take measurements AND I HAVE JUST NOW SAW that the board has to be 100x100 mm or less mine was 120 x 97mm sooooo I have to remake the wires and the pcb design ;-; sucks to not read lol.

Done it is now 100x95.250 mm Yey

Well I started on doing the routing at 6:00.
Note: 6.30 now I'm playing like a game of cutting out and it's getting on my nerves. It's really annoying always a wire is there and now it won't go good and have to redo the wires.

Note: 6:50 I'm done I did smth and It looks good.

Yeah I kinda rotated them a bit and put them like which one was with which seems like I was stupid lol!!

MORE SCREWS!!!

Also cool note: I just found out that Imogen Heap was feat. in I'm God I thought the voices were the same but whatever it's even cooler now that I did all this stuff and it's nice!!
also the timer for the wiring:

All right Now I have to just create the 3d housing!

It's now 19:31 and starting to create the 3d model!

its like 21:00 rn I finished doing the assembly on the pcb In Fusion and did the case thingy like 40% done

Alright I have done the 3d stuff! The Top part I will manually cut it after print as I'm not going to risk it not fitting.

Single only thing now is to create a simple firmware for starters and that's kind of it!

I'm now doing the firmware using KMK. NOTE It took me 30 mins. DK if it's good but i can reprogram if I get the kit.
